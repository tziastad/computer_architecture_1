**TODO - Update your name in this readme. Leave 1 space after the ## to preserve the text formating**

**TODO - Add a badge from travis CI here.**
This is how: go to https://travis-ci.com/UoI-CSE-MYY505/lab03-ghUsername.
**Do not use travis-ci.org !!!**
Click on the "build badge" (to the right of the organization/repo name,
select "master" and "Markdown" and copy the text into here, replacing this paragraph.
(Edit this file in GitHub (click on README.md and then the pencil icon) or locally with a text editor).


## Problem statement:
Write a MIPS assembly subroutine which calculates the odd parity of a 32-bit word and another subroutine which calculates the parities of an array of 32 words.
 
## Files to work on
* `lab03.asm` 
* `README.md` to add your name and badge<br/>
* You may optionally change `Lab03TestParity.java` to add more test inputs.<br/>
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. 
      
## Running 
* To run the program interactively, start MARS: `java -jar MarsMYY505_4_5.jar`, and load the .asm file
* To run the test using munit: <br/>
```
    javac -cp munit.jar Lab03TestParity.java
    java -jar munit.jar lab03.asm Lab03TestParity.class
```
