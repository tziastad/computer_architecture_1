## Problem statement:
Introduction to MIPS assembly using MARS.
Automated testing using munit (Junit and MARS).
 
## Files to work on
* `lab01.asm` 
* `Lab01Test.java` 
* `README.md` to add your name and badge<br/>
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. 
      
## Running 
* To run the program interactively, start MARS: `java -jar MarsMYY505_4_5.jar`, load lab01.asm
* To run the test using munit: <br/>
```
    javac -cp munit.jar Lab01Test.java
    java -jar munit.jar lab01.asm Lab01Test.class
```
