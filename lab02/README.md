## Problem statement:
Write a MIPS assembly program which counts the occurences of each type of char in a string.
 
## Files to work on
* `lab02.asm` 
* `README.md` to add your name and badge<br/>
* You may optionally change `Lab02TestCountChar.java` to add more test inputs.<br/>
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. 
      
## Running 
* To run the program interactively, start MARS: `java -jar MarsMYY505_4_5.jar`, and load the .asm file
* To run the test using munit: <br/>
```
    javac -cp munit.jar Lab02TestCountChar.java
    java -jar munit.jar lab02.asm Lab02TestCountChar.class
```
